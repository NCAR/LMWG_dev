# LMWG_dev
Repository to track LMWG development simulations & relevant discussions to land model development.

### Development simulations
- The list of development simulations can be found under _"Issues"_.
- Should including cases directories, namelist changes, parameter files, model sandboxes, etc.

### Issues: Each simulation is a github issue.
- Simulation requests should be entered as "Run request".
- Please provide as much details as possible.
- Simulations can be sorted with labels for individual:
  - compset: FATES_SP or BGC_crop,
  - tag: ctsm5_1dev138, ctsm5_3dev002,
  - feature or topic: Siberian hole, calibration, crop yields
- Generally simulations here will be from offline, land only simulations.
  - Coupled model simulations being grouped on the [AMWG_dev repository](https://github.com/NCAR/amwg_dev) (which inspired the creation of this repository!)
  - See also the new [CESM_dev repo]((https://github.com/NCAR/cesm_dev), with simulations and discussions for CESM3 development.
### Discussions: on simulations relevant to CTSM6 development could be posted under "Discussions"
- Discusssions can also include key plots as well as link to relevent diagnostics.
- Discussions can also group several simulations together to investigate an issue or topic being investigated.
